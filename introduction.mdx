# Architect API

> Research Preview: State-of-the-art project specifications for AI coding agents

## Before you build, pre.dev it.

<Card title="Get Started in 5 Minutes" icon="rocket" horizontal href="/quickstart">
  Follow our quickstart guide to generate your first specification.
</Card>

<Card title="View API Reference" icon="terminal" horizontal href="/api-reference/overview">
  Complete API documentation with examples and authentication.
</Card>

<Card title="Setup MCP Integration" icon="plug" horizontal href="/mcp-integration/setup">
  Use Architect API directly in Claude, Cursor, and other agents.
</Card>

## The Problem

AI agents drift off scope, miss critical features, and make poor architectural decisions without comprehensive planning.

- **Scope Drift** - Agents go off track without detailed requirements
- **Missing Features** - Critical functionality gets overlooked
- **Poor Architecture** - In-the-moment decisions lead to technical debt
- **No Progress Tracking** - Difficulty monitoring agent implementation

## The Solution

Generate detailed specifications in minutes that guide agents with comprehensive roadmaps, shifting from vibe coding to vibe PM'ing.

### What You Get

<Accordion title="Complete Feature Breakdown">
  Every feature organized by category with clear requirements and acceptance criteria
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Technical Architecture Recommendations">
  Technology stack suggestions, system design patterns, and infrastructure setup
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implementation Milestones with Effort Estimates">
  Logical phases with task breakdowns and time estimates for planning
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Stories and Acceptance Criteria">
  Detailed requirements that ensure agents build what you actually need
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Built-in Task Tracking System">
  Progress checkboxes that you update as your agent implements features:
  - `[ ]` To Do → `[→]` In Progress → `[✓]` Complete → `[⊘]` Skipped
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Universal Markdown Format">
  Ready for any agent - Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, v0, Claude Desktop, or custom tools
</Accordion>

## Active Progress Management

Each spec includes a built-in task tracking legend that transforms you from a developer to a project manager:

```markdown
# Task Status Legend
- [ ] To Do
- [→] In Progress
- [✓] Complete
- [⊘] Skipped (with reason)
```

Track your agent's progress as it implements features. Update task statuses to maintain a living document that keeps both you and your AI aligned.

    ### Traditional Approach
    Idea → Immediate Coding → Scope Drift → Rework → More Drift → Eventually Ship

    **Problems:** Wasted time, poor quality, incomplete features
  </div>
  <div>
    ### Architect API Approach
    Idea → Comprehensive Spec → Guided Development → On-Target Delivery

    **Benefits:** Clear roadmap, better architecture, complete feature set, progress tracking
  </div>
</Columns>

## Universal Compatibility

Works seamlessly with all modern AI coding tools:
