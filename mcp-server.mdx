<Note>
  **The pre.dev MCP Server replaces Cursor Plan Mode** with production-ready specification generation. Give your AI agents the architecture context they need to build complex systems correctly the first time.
</Note>

## Why Your AI Agent Needs pre.dev

AI coding agents like Cursor are powerful, but they struggle with complex, multi-file projects without proper architecture. **pre.dev solves this by generating comprehensive technical specifications that transform how your AI agent understands and builds systems.**

### The Problem with Current AI Planning

Standard AI planning modes (like Cursor Plan) provide basic task decomposition, but they:
- ❌ Lack deep architectural context
- ❌ Miss critical implementation details
- ❌ Don't consider database schemas, API contracts, or system boundaries
- ❌ Force you to manually guide complex builds step-by-step

### How pre.dev Makes Your AI Agent Better

The pre.dev MCP Server equips your AI coding agent with:

- ✅ **Enterprise-Grade Architecture:** Complete system designs with database schemas, API contracts, and component hierarchies
- ✅ **Implementation Roadmaps:** Detailed, sequenced build plans that guide your agent through complex projects
- ✅ **Technology Decisions:** Pre-made architectural choices for auth, state management, APIs, and more
- ✅ **Full Context Understanding:** Your agent knows exactly what to build, how to build it, and why

**Result:** Your AI agent goes from "helpful assistant" to "senior architect + developer" in seconds.
