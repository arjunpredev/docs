# Choosing Spec Level

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Your Project | Recommended | Why |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| MVP or prototype | **Fast Spec** | Milestones + Stories sufficient |
| Personal project | **Fast Spec** | No need for granular subtasks |
| Small team (<5) | **Fast Spec** | Stories provide enough detail |
| Enterprise application | **Deep Spec** | Need subtasks for team coordination |
| Complex system | **Deep Spec** | Detailed acceptance criteria required |
| Mission-critical | **Deep Spec** | Subtask-level planning critical |
| Large team (5+) | **Deep Spec** | Subtasks enable better task distribution |

## Fast Spec: When to Use

**Structure:** Milestones > User Stories

**Best for:**
- MVPs and prototypes
- Personal/side projects
- Rapid iteration workflows
- Solo developers
- When you'll figure out implementation details as you go

**What you get:**
- High-level milestones
- User stories for each feature
- Basic acceptance criteria
- No granular subtasks

**Cost:** 10 credits

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Weekend projects
- Proof-of-concept builds
- Small utility applications
- Learning new technologies
- Quick validation of ideas

## Deep Spec: When to Use

**Structure:** Milestones > User Stories with Acceptance Criteria > Granular Subtasks

**Best for:**
- Enterprise applications
- Complex architectures
- Team coordination
- Mission-critical systems
- When you need implementation-level planning

**What you get:**
- Detailed milestones
- User stories with comprehensive acceptance criteria
- **Granular implementation subtasks**
- Task-level breakdown for delegation

**Cost:** 50 credits

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Large-scale applications
- Multi-team projects
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Systems with complex business logic
- Applications requiring detailed audit trails

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Fast Spec | Deep Spec |

| Structure | Milestones > Stories | Milestones > Stories > Subtasks |
| Milestones | ✅ | ✅ |
| User Stories | ✅ | ✅ |
| Basic Acceptance Criteria | ✅ | ✅ |
| Detailed Acceptance Criteria | ❌ | ✅ |
| Granular Subtasks | ❌ | ✅ |
| Architecture Depth | Good | Comprehensive |
| Risk Analysis | Basic | Detailed |
| Effort Estimates | High-level | Granular |
| Team Coordination | Limited | Excellent |

## Can I Upgrade?

Yes! You can easily upgrade from Fast to Deep Spec.

### How to Upgrade

1. **Use your existing spec as context:**
```json
{
  "input": "Generate a deep spec for this project with full implementation details",
  "currentContext": "[paste your existing Fast Spec content]"
}
```

2. **The API automatically handles the upgrade:**
   - Respects your existing architecture decisions
   - Adds detailed acceptance criteria to existing stories
   - Generates granular subtasks for implementation
   - Maintains consistency with your current spec

3. **Result:** A comprehensive Deep Spec that builds upon your Fast Spec foundation

### When to Upgrade

**Upgrade when you realize you need:**
- More detailed implementation guidance
- Better team coordination
- Granular task breakdown for delegation
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Detailed risk analysis

**Don't upgrade if:**
- You're happy with the current level of detail
- The project scope remains small
- You prefer to figure out implementation details as you go

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Fast Spec Economics
- **Cost:** 10 credits (depending on your plan)
- **Processing Time:** 30-40 seconds
- **Implementation Time:** 2-4x longer (figure out details during development)
- **Best for:** Projects where speed-to-idea matters more than detailed planning

### Deep Spec Economics
- **Cost:** 50 credits (depending on your plan)
- **Processing Time:** 2-3 minutes
- **Implementation Time:** 1.5-2x faster (detailed guidance reduces unknowns)
- **Best for:** Projects where thorough planning prevents costly mistakes

## Decision Framework

### Ask Yourself:

1. **How large is the project?**
   - Small (1-2 weeks): Fast Spec
   - Medium (1-3 months): Fast Spec or Deep Spec
   - Large (3+ months): Deep Spec

2. **How many people will work on it?**
   - Solo: Fast Spec
   - Small team (2-5): Fast Spec
   - Large team (5+): Deep Spec

3. **What's the domain complexity?**
   - Simple CRUD: Fast Spec
   - Complex business logic: Deep Spec
   - Regulated industry: Deep Spec

4. **What's your risk tolerance?**
   - High (can pivot quickly): Fast Spec
   - Medium (some planning needed): Fast Spec
   - Low (detailed planning required): Deep Spec

5. **What's your timeline?**
   - ASAP: Fast Spec (faster generation)
   - Planned: Either (depends on other factors)

### Quick Decision Rules

- **If ANY of these are true, use Deep Spec:**
  - Enterprise/commercial application
  - 3+ month timeline
  - 5+ person team
  - Mission-critical functionality
  - Complex domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)

- **Otherwise, use Fast Spec**

## Examples

### Fast Spec Projects
- Personal blog website
- Simple task tracker
- Recipe collection app
- Local event finder
- Portfolio website

### Deep Spec Projects
- Healthcare patient management system
- Financial trading platform
- Enterprise CRM system
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform
- Complex e-commerce marketplace

## Changing Your Mind

**Generated the wrong level? No problem!**

- **Fast Spec too basic?** Generate a Deep Spec with the Fast Spec as context
- **Deep Spec overkill?** You can still use it - just skip the granular subtasks if they're too detailed

The beauty of Architect API is that specs are living documents. Start with what feels right, and adjust as needed.
