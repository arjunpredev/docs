```yaml
name: Generate Feature Spec
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  generate-spec:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'needs-spec'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate Spec
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/fast-spec \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_API_KEY }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"input\": \"${{ github.event.issue.body }}\"}" \
            > feature-spec.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent spec format across all features
- Automated documentation generation
- Integration with existing development workflow
- Reduced manual overhead

## Use Case 5: Multi-Agent Workflows

### The Scenario
You want different AI agents to handle different aspects of development (one for backend, one for frontend, etc.).

### Without Architect API
- Agents have conflicting understandings of requirements
- Different architectural decisions
- Integration challenges
- Inconsistent implementation

### With Architect API
- All agents work from the same specification
- Consistent architectural context
- Clear boundaries for each agent's responsibilities
- Coordinated development across multiple agents
