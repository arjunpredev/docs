<Note>
  **Research Preview** - The Architect API is currently in research preview. Features and pricing may change as we continue to improve the platform.
</Note>

## Overview

The Architect API transforms simple natural language descriptions of software projects into structured specifications optimized for AI coding agents. 

**Input:** Plain English descriptions like "Build a chat app" or "Add authentication to my API"

**Output:** Comprehensive technical specifications with implementation milestones, user stories, and task breakdowns


## Key Features

- **Structured Output:** Hierarchical spec format (Milestones → Stories → Subtasks)
- **Task Tracking:** Built-in progress management with markdown checkboxes
- **Complexity Estimation:** Complexity scores per milestone and subtask
- **Web Sync:** Automatic project creation on pre.dev with unique URL

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/fast-spec \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Build a REST API for task management with user authentication",
    "outputFormat": "url"
  }'
```

## Specification Levels

| Endpoint | Use Case | Cost | Processing Time | Subtasks |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|----------|
| `fast-spec` | Quick prototypes, MVPs | 10 credits | ~30-40 seconds | High-level only |
| `deep-spec` | Production features, complex systems | 50 credits | ~2-3 minutes | Granular breakdown |

See [Choosing Spec Level](/guides/choosing-spec-level) for detailed comparison.

## Response Format

Specs are returned as structured markdown with:

- **Technical Stack:** Recommended technologies and dependencies
- **Implementation Milestones:** Phased delivery plan with complexity estimates
- **User Stories:** Feature requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Subtask Breakdown:** Granular implementation steps with checkboxes

### Task Tracking Format

```markdown
- [ ] Not started
- [→] In progress
- [✓] Complete
- [\] Skipped
```

## Web Dashboard

Each API request creates a synced project at `pre.dev/projects/{id}` with:

- Web-based spec editor for iteration
- Team collaboration and progress tracking
- Version history
