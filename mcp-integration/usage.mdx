# Using MCP with AI Agents

## Basic Usage

Once configured, you can generate specs through natural conversation:

### Example Conversations

**User:** "I want to build a social media app for book lovers. Can you generate a detailed spec for this?"

**Agent:** *Uses Architect API via MCP*

"I've generated a comprehensive specification for your book-focused social network. The spec includes..."

### Triggering Spec Generation

You can naturally request specs with phrases like:
- "Generate a spec for..."
- "Create a detailed plan for..."
- "I need a specification for..."
- "Plan out an architecture for..."

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Iterative Refinement

**User:** "Generate a fast spec for a recipe sharing app"

*Reviews output*

**User:** "Now generate a deep spec that includes meal planning and grocery list integration"

### Feature Addition

**User:** "I have an existing recipe app. Generate a spec for adding social features like comments and ratings."

### Context Preservation

**User:** "Generate a spec for adding real-time chat to my existing e-commerce platform that already has user auth, product catalog, and checkout"

The MCP server automatically handles the `currentContext` parameter to ensure new specs respect your existing architecture.

## Best Practices

### Natural Language Descriptions

Write descriptions as you would explain to a senior developer:

✅ **Good:** "Build a SaaS project management tool with kanban boards, sprint planning, time tracking, team collaboration, and Slack/GitHub integrations"

❌ **Bad:** "Build app"

### Provide Context When Available

If you're adding to an existing project, mention what already exists:

✅ "Add real-time notifications to my existing chat app that has user auth, message history, and group chats"

### Iterate on Specs

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use the generated spec as a starting point:

1. Generate initial spec
2. Review and identify gaps
3. Request refinements
4. Iterate until satisfied

### Combine with Agent Capabilities

MCP works best when combined with your agent's existing capabilities:

**User:** "Generate a spec for a fitness tracking app, then help me implement the user authentication module first"

## MCP vs Direct API

### When to Use MCP

**Best for:**
- Interactive development workflows
- Exploratory conversations
- Natural language requirements
- Working within your development environment
- Quick iterations and refinements

### When to Use Direct API

**Best for:**
- Batch processing
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Programmatic generation
- Automated workflows
- Large-scale operations

## Agent-Specific Tips

### Claude Desktop

- **Long Context:** Leverage Claude's large context window for complex requirements
- **Conversational Flow:** MCP integrates seamlessly with natural conversation patterns
- **Multiple Specs:** Generate multiple related specs in one conversation

### Cursor

- **Deep Linking:** Specs automatically integrate with Cursor's deep linking
- **Project Context:** MCP understands your current project structure
- **Seamless Switching:** Move between spec generation and implementation

### Windsurf

- **Integrated Workflow:** MCP fits naturally into Windsurf's development flow
- **Context Awareness:** Server understands your current workspace
- **Quick Iterations:** Easy to refine specs without leaving the environment

## Troubleshooting MCP Usage

### Agent Doesn't Recognize Spec Requests

**Problem:** MCP server not responding to generation requests.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify MCP is properly configured ([setup guide](/mcp-integration/setup))
2. Try restarting your agent
3. Check agent logs for MCP errors
4. Ensure you have sufficient generations available

### Generated Spec Missing Context

**Problem:** Spec doesn't reflect your existing project structure.

**Solutions:**
1. Be more explicit about existing features in your request
2. Mention the current tech stack and architecture
3. Provide the existing project description in your prompt

### Spec Generation Fails

**Problem:** MCP returns an error instead of a spec.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your API key validity
2. Verify you have sufficient generations
3. Simplify your request if it's too complex
4. Try again (temporary server issues)

## Advanced Patterns

### Spec Chaining

Generate related specs in sequence:

1. "Generate a spec for the core authentication system"
2. "Now generate a spec for the user profile management that integrates with this auth system"
3. "Add notification preferences to the profile system"

### Architecture Evolution

Use MCP to evolve your architecture over time:

1. Start with core features
2. Add complementary features
3. Integrate third-party services
4. Scale infrastructure components

### Team Collaboration

Multiple team members can use MCP to:
- Generate specs for their feature areas
- Ensure consistency across the project
- Maintain shared architectural context

## Performance Considerations

### Generation Speed

- **Fast Spec:** 30-45 seconds
- **Deep Spec:** 2-3 minutes
- Use async mode for better UX with longer specs

### Rate Limiting

MCP respects the same rate limits as direct API usage. Be mindful of:
- Concurrent request limits (based on your tier)
- Monthly generation caps
- Fair use policies

### Context Window Management

Keep requests focused and specific to avoid:
- Hitting context limits
- Generating overly broad specs
- Missing important details

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Development Planning

Use MCP at the start of development cycles:
1. Describe the feature or project
2. Generate comprehensive spec
3. Review and refine with the agent
4. Begin implementation with clear context

### During Development

Use MCP for mid-project additions:
1. Identify new requirements
2. Generate incremental specs
3. Integrate with existing context
4. Continue development seamlessly

### Post-Development

Use MCP for future enhancements:
1. Plan next phase features
2. Generate specs for extensions
3. Maintain architectural consistency
4. Scale the application thoughtfully
