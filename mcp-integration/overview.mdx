# MCP Integration Overview

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a universal plugin system that allows AI agents to access external tools and APIs seamlessly.

With MCP, you can:
- Generate specs directly from Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP-enabled agents
- Have natural conversations that trigger spec processing
- No need to leave your development environment

## Why Use MCP?

### Interactive Development
Have a conversation with your AI agent about your project, and generate specs on the fly.

<Card title="Example Conversation" icon="message-circle">
  **You:** "I want to build a social media app for book lovers. Can you generate a detailed spec for this?"

  **Agent:** *"I've generated a comprehensive specification for your book-focused social network. The spec includes user authentication, book discovery features, reading groups, and more. Here's the link: [spec-url]"*
</Card>

### Seamless Integration
Once configured, spec processing is just a natural part of your conversation.

### Universal Compatibility
Works with any MCP-enabled agent:
- Claude Desktop
- Claude Code (CLI)
- Cursor
- VS Code
- Windsurf
- [Other supported agents]

## MCP vs Direct API

| Feature | MCP Integration | Direct API |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Best For | Interactive, exploratory | Programmatic, batch, CI/CD |
| Setup | One-time config file | Per-request authentication |
| Use Case | Development workflow | Automation, scripts |
| Natural Language | ✅ Conversational | ❌ Structured requests |

## How It Works

### 1. Configuration
Add Architect API to your MCP configuration file with your API key.

### 2. Natural Conversation
Simply ask your agent to generate a spec in natural language.

### 3. Automatic Processing
Agent uses Architect API behind the scenes to process comprehensive specifications.

### 4. Seamless Results
Get spec URLs and continue your development conversation without interruption.
