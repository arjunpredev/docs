## What is a "Generation"?

A generation = one AI model inference call. Specs require multiple LLM calls for:
- Architecture analysis
- Feature breakdown
- Milestone planning
- Story generation
- Risk assessment

**Cost is per spec request, not per feature.** Generate as many features in one spec as needed.

### Generation Sources (Priority Order)

1. **Prototype Credits** - Used first if available
2. **Daily Allocation** - Based on subscription tier
3. **Rollover Credits** - Unused daily credits (if applicable)

Check remaining generations:
```bash
GET /api/generation-usage
```
