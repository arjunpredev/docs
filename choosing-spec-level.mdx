## Fast Spec: When to Use

**Structure:** Milestones > User Stories

**Best for:**
- MVPs and prototypes
- Personal/side projects
- Rapid iteration workflows
- Solo developers
- When you'll figure out implementation details as you go

**What you get:**
- High-level milestones
- User stories for each feature
- Basic acceptance criteria
- No granular subtasks

**Cost:** 10 credits

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Weekend projects
- Proof-of-concept builds
- Small utility applications
- Learning new technologies
- Quick validation of ideas

## Deep Spec: When to Use

**Structure:** Milestones > User Stories with Acceptance Criteria > Granular Subtasks

**Best for:**
- Enterprise applications
- Complex architectures
- Team coordination
- Mission-critical systems
- When you need implementation-level planning

**What you get:**
- Detailed milestones
- User stories with comprehensive acceptance criteria
- **Granular implementation subtasks**
- Task-level breakdown for delegation

**Cost:** 50 credits

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Large-scale applications
- Multi-team projects
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Systems with complex business logic
- Applications requiring detailed audit trails

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Fast Spec Economics
- **Cost:** 10 credits (depending on your plan)
- **Processing Time:** 30-40 seconds
- **Implementation Time:** 2-4x longer (figure out details during development)
- **Best for:** Projects where speed-to-idea matters more than detailed planning

### Deep Spec Economics
- **Cost:** 50 credits (depending on your plan)
- **Processing Time:** 2-3 minutes
- **Implementation Time:** 1.5-2x faster (detailed guidance reduces unknowns)
- **Best for:** Projects where thorough planning prevents costly mistakes

## Decision Framework

### Ask Yourself:

1. **How large is the project?**
   - Small (1-2 weeks): Fast Spec
   - Medium (1-3 months): Fast Spec or Deep Spec
   - Large (3+ months): Deep Spec

2. **How many people will work on it?**
   - Solo: Fast Spec
   - Small team (2-5): Fast Spec
   - Large team (5+): Deep Spec

3. **What's the domain complexity?**
   - Simple CRUD: Fast Spec
   - Complex business logic: Deep Spec
   - Regulated industry: Deep Spec

4. **What's your risk tolerance?**
   - High (can pivot quickly): Fast Spec
   - Medium (some planning needed): Fast Spec
   - Low (detailed planning required): Deep Spec

5. **What's your timeline?**
   - ASAP: Fast Spec (faster generation)
   - Planned: Either (depends on other factors)

### Quick Decision Rules

- **If ANY of these are true, use Deep Spec:**
  - Enterprise/commercial application
  - 3+ month timeline
  - 5+ person team
  - Mission-critical functionality
  - Complex domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)

- **Otherwise, use Fast Spec**

## Documentation Scraping with Both Levels

Both Fast Spec and Deep Spec support documentation scraping:

- **Option:** Provide documentation URLs for any external APIs, frameworks, or services
- **Automatic:** Documentation is scraped in parallel (no additional time)
- **Archived:** Each platform gets its own organized ZIP file
- **Benefit:** Complete context for your development team

**Example Use Cases:**
- Stripe API documentation for payment processing
- React/Vue/Angular documentation for frontend architecture
- AWS/GCP/Azure documentation for infrastructure
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance documentation for regulated industries
- Third-party service APIs for integrations

See [Documentation Scraping Guide](/guides/documentation-scraping) for details.

## Examples

### Fast Spec Projects
- Personal blog website
- Simple task tracker
- Recipe collection app
- Local event finder
- Portfolio website

### Deep Spec Projects
- Healthcare patient management system
- Financial trading platform
- Enterprise CRM system
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform
- Complex e-commerce marketplace

## Changing Your Mind

**Generated the wrong level? No problem!**

- **Fast Spec too basic?** Generate a Deep Spec with the Fast Spec as context
- **Deep Spec overkill?** You can still use it - just skip the granular subtasks if they're too detailed

The beauty of Architect API is that specs are living documents. Start with what feels right, and adjust as needed.
