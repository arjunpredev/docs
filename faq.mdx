# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Why generate a spec instead of just building?

**The Context Engineering Problem:**

AI agents work best with structured, bounded context. Conversational context is:
- Unstructured (scattered across messages)
- Ambiguous (no clear acceptance criteria)
- Inefficient (verbose, redundant)
- Ephemeral (lost when session ends)

**Architect API solves this by providing engineered context:**
- ✅ Structured hierarchy (milestones → stories → subtasks)
- ✅ Clear boundaries (acceptance criteria, task tracking)
- ✅ Efficient encoding (dense, navigable)
- ✅ Persistent (synced to pre.dev)

A comprehensive spec ensures your agent:
- Knows all required features upfront
- Makes better architectural decisions
- Stays within defined boundaries
- Delivers exactly what's specified

**You're not just generating docs - you're engineering optimal agent context.**

### How detailed are the specifications?

**Fast Spec:** Milestones → User Stories with basic acceptance criteria
**Deep Spec:** Milestones → User Stories with detailed Acceptance Criteria → Granular implementation Subtasks

Deep Spec provides task-level breakdown suitable for delegating work across large teams.

### What happens when I generate a spec?

Each API request creates a **synced project on pre.dev** where you can:
- Visualize system architecture with interactive diagrams
- Continue refining your spec through the web UI
- Track implementation progress with team members
- View version history of changes

The returned URL is not just a static markdown file - it's a live project workspace.

### Can I edit the generated spec?

Yes! Edit the markdown locally OR log into pre.dev and refine your spec through the web UI. All changes sync to your project.

### What if my project requirements change?

Use the `currentContext` parameter to generate incremental specs for new features that respect your existing architecture. Your pre.dev project will be updated with the new features added to the existing spec.

## Choosing Spec Levels

### Which spec level should I choose?

- **Fast Spec (10 gen):** MVPs, prototypes, small-medium projects
- **Deep Spec (50 gen):** Complex systems, enterprise apps, large teams

### Can I upgrade from Fast to Deep Spec?

Yes, you can generate a Deep Spec using the existing project as context. The new spec will include all the detailed subtasks and expanded acceptance criteria while respecting your current architecture.

## Integration

### Can I use this with [Agent Name]?

Yes! Output is universal markdown that works with:
- Cursor
- Lovable
- Bolt
- v0
- Claude Desktop
- Any agent that accepts text context

### How do I integrate with my CI/CD pipeline?

Use the API endpoints directly in your build scripts. For example:

```bash
# Generate spec as part of your project setup
curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/api/fast-spec \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Build a new feature", "currentContext": "Existing app description"}' \
  > spec.md
```

### Does this replace writing PRDs?

No, Architect API complements PRDs. Use PRDs for stakeholder alignment, then generate Architect specs for agent implementation. The spec provides the technical detail and structure agents need.

## Technical

### What format is the output?

Comprehensive markdown files that include:
- Feature breakdown
- Technical architecture
- Milestones with effort estimates
- User stories
- Risk analysis

### How long do specs take to generate?

- Fast Spec: 30-40 seconds (sync), instant (async)
- Deep Spec: 2-3 minutes (sync), instant (async)

**Significantly faster than competitors:**
- Factory AI Specification Mode: Several minutes for comparable depth
- Claude Code: No structured spec generation

### What happens if generation fails?

Failures are rare but can occur due to:
- Invalid input format
- Temporary service issues
- Rate limiting

Failed requests return detailed error messages. For async requests, use `/api/spec-status/:requestId` to check status. Retry failed requests - they're not billed if unsuccessful.

## Pricing & Access

### Is there a free trial?

Yes! New solo users get 1 free Fast Spec.

### What's included in Solo Premium?

- Unlimited daily generations (500/month cap)
- Access to both Fast and Deep Specs
- Full API access
- MCP integration
- Priority support

### Do I need a subscription for MCP?

No, MCP works with any active subscription tier that includes API access (Solo Premium and above).

## API & MCP

### What's the difference between API and MCP?

- **API:** Programmatic access, batch processing, CI/CD integration
- **MCP:** Interactive, conversational, seamless agent integration

Both use the same underlying spec generation.

### Is the API stable?

This is a research preview. Core functionality is stable, but expect improvements and enhancements over time.

## Privacy & Security

### What happens to my project data?

Project data is encrypted and stored securely. Only you and authorized team members can access your specs. Data is used solely for providing the service and improving the product.

### Can I delete my generated specs?

Yes, you can delete projects from your pre.dev dashboard. Deleted projects are permanently removed from our systems.
