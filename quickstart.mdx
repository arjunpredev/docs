# Quick Start

Get your first specification in under 5 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key" icon="key">
    <Accordion title="Solo Users">
      1. Sign up at [pre.dev](https://pre.dev)
      2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
      3. Copy your **User ID** (this is your API key)

      Your User ID looks like: `user_2abc123def456`
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Enterprise Organizations">
      1. Sign up at [pre.dev](https://pre.dev)
      2. Go to **Organization Settings** → **API Keys**
      3. Generate or copy your enterprise API key

      Enterprise keys look like: `ek_prod_abc123...`
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your First Request" icon="terminal">
    Choose your preferred method to generate a Fast Spec (10 credits, ~30-40 seconds):

    <Accordion title="cURL">
      ```bash
      curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/api/fast-spec \
        -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "input": "Build a task management app with team collaboration",
          "outputFormat": "url"
        }'
      ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Python">
      ```python
      import requests

      response = requests.post(
          'https://api.pre.dev/api/fast-spec',
          headers={'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
          json={
              'input': 'Build a task management app with team collaboration',
              'outputFormat': 'url'
          }
      )

      result = response.json()
      print(f"Spec URL: {result['url']}")
      ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="JavaScript">
      ```javascript
      const response = await fetch('https://api.pre.dev/api/fast-spec', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          input: 'Build a task management app with team collaboration',
          outputFormat: 'url'
        })
      });

      const result = await response.json();
      console.log(`Spec URL: ${result.url}`);
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enhance with Documentation (Optional)" icon="book">
    For better results, you can provide documentation URLs that Architect will reference:

    <Accordion title="Add Documentation URLs">
      ```bash
      curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/api/fast-spec \
        -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "input": "Build a customer support ticketing system",
          "outputFormat": "url",
          "docURLs": [
            "https://docs.pre.dev",
            "https://docs.stripe.com"
          ]
        }'
      ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why Documentation URLs?">
      Architect leverages external documentation to:
      - Generate more accurate specifications
      - Reference specific technical requirements
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Specification" icon="eye">
    Your spec is delivered as a comprehensive markdown file that includes:

    - ✅ **Executive summary** and feature breakdown
    - ✅ **Technical architecture** recommendations
    - ✅ **Implementation phases** with task checklists
    - ✅ **User stories** with acceptance criteria
    - ✅ **Built-in task tracking system**

    <Accordion title="Understanding Task Tracking">
      Every spec includes a progress tracking legend:

      ```markdown
      # Task Status Legend
      - [ ] To Do
      - [→] In Progress
      - [✓] Complete
      - [⊘] Skipped (with reason)
      ```

      Update task statuses as your agent implements features to track progress.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use with Your Favorite Agent" icon="bot">
    <Accordion title="Cursor">
      1. Paste the entire spec into your Cursor chat
      2. Tell Cursor: *"Let's implement this spec. Start with Phase 1, Task 1"*
      3. As tasks complete, ask Cursor to mark them `[✓]` in the spec
      4. Reference specific sections as needed
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Lovable / Bolt / v0">
      1. Copy the spec URL or markdown content
      2. Paste into the tool as initial context
      3. Break implementation into phases from the spec
      4. Keep spec open in another tab for reference
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Claude Desktop (via MCP)">
      1. Once MCP is configured, just ask Claude to generate a spec
      2. Claude will use the Architect API automatically
      3. Reference the spec URL in future conversations
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your First Spec

Your generated specification includes several key sections:

<Accordion title="Executive Summary">
  High-level overview of the project, target users, and success metrics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Features Breakdown">
  All features organized by category (Authentication, Core Features, Admin, etc.).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Technical Architecture">
  Recommended tech stack, system design patterns, and infrastructure setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implementation Milestones">
  Logical phases with effort estimates and task breakdowns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Stories">
  Detailed requirements with specific acceptance criteria.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task Checklists">
  Granular, actionable tasks with progress tracking checkboxes.
</Accordion>

## Active Progress Management

The key to success with Architect API is **active progress management**:

1. **Mark tasks as you start them:** Change `[ ]` to `[→]`
2. **Mark tasks when complete:** Change `[→]` to `[✓]`
3. **Question skipped tasks:** If your agent skips something, ask why
4. **Verify acceptance criteria:** Don't mark complete without verification

  Your job shifts from writing code to managing progress. Actively interrupt your agent to ensure tasks are properly tracked and completed.
