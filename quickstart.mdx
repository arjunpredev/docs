<Note>
  **Research Preview** - The pre.dev Architect API is currently in research preview. Features and pricing may change as we continue to improve the platform.
</Note>

## Welcome to the pre.dev Architect API

The pre.dev Architect API transforms simple natural language descriptions of software projects into structured specifications optimized for AI coding agents. 

**Input:** Plain English descriptions like "Build a chat app" or "Add authentication to my API"

**Output:** Comprehensive technical specifications with implementation milestones, user stories, and task breakdowns


## Key Features

- **Structured Output:** Hierarchical spec format (Milestones → Stories → Subtasks)
- **Task Tracking:** Built-in progress management with markdown checkboxes
- **Complexity Estimation:** Complexity scores per milestone and subtask
- **Web Sync:** Automatic project creation on pre.dev, along with links to open up the project in Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, or v0.

## How to Use It

The pre.dev Architect API can be integrated in two ways:

- **API Documentation Generation:** Generate comprehensive API specs and documentation from natural language descriptions
- **SDK Generation:** Create Python or Node.js SDKs with proper type definitions, documentation, and client libraries

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# No installation required - use curl directly
```

```python Python
pip install predev-api
```

```javascript Node
npm install predev-api
```
</CodeGroup>

## Specification Levels

| Endpoint | Use Case | Cost | Processing Time | Subtasks |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|----------|
| `fast-spec` | Quick prototypes, MVPs | 10 credits | ~30-40 seconds | High-level only |
| `deep-spec` | Production features, complex systems | 50 credits | ~2-3 minutes | Granular breakdown |

See [Choosing Spec Level](/guides/choosing-spec-level) for detailed comparison.

## Generating a Fast Spec

Here's how to generate a specification using the `fast-spec` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.pre.dev/fast-spec \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Build a REST API for task management with user authentication",
    "outputFormat": "url"
  }'
```

```python Python
from predev_api import PredevAPI

client = PredevAPI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.fast_spec(
    input="Build a REST API for task management with user authentication",
    output_format="url"
)

print(response)
```

```javascript Node
import { PredevAPI } from 'predev-api';

const client = new PredevAPI({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

const response = await client.fastSpec({
  input: "Build a REST API for task management with user authentication",
  outputFormat: "url"
});

console.log(response);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Format

Specs are returned as structured markdown with:

- **Technical Stack:** Recommended technologies and dependencies
- **Implementation Milestones:** Phased delivery plan with complexity estimates
- **User Stories:** Feature requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Subtask Breakdown:** Granular implementation steps with checkboxes

### Task Tracking Format

```markdown
- [ ] Not started
- [→] In progress
- [✓] Complete
- [\] Skipped
```
