## Best Practices for Deep Spec

### Input Quality for Complex Projects
- **Detailed business requirements** - Include specific compliance needs
- **Technical constraints** - Existing systems, performance requirements
- **Scale expectations** - User numbers, data volume, transaction rates
- **Integration landscape** - Existing tools, APIs, third-party services

### Planning for Enterprise Projects
- **Allocate sufficient time** - Deep specs can take 2-3 minutes
- **Use async mode** for the best experience with complex inputs
- **Review thoroughly** - Deep specs contain extensive detail requiring careful review
- **Share with stakeholders** - Use as a comprehensive project brief

### Cost Considerations
- **Higher investment upfront** - 50 credits vs 10 for Fast Spec
- **Significant time savings downstream** - Reduces costly rework and scope changes
- **Better resource allocation** - Clear requirements prevent over/under-engineering
