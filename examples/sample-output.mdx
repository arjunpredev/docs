# Sample Generated Specifications

## Understanding the Spec Output

### File Format
All specifications are generated as comprehensive markdown files that include:
- Executive summary
- Feature breakdown
- Technical architecture
- Implementation tasks with checkboxes
- Milestones and estimates
- User stories with acceptance criteria

### Task Tracking System

Every spec includes a **task tracking legend** at the top:

```markdown
# Task Status Legend
- [ ] To Do
- [→] In Progress
- [✓] Complete
- [\] Skipped (with reason)
```

This allows you to track progress as your agent implements features.

### Example Task Structure

```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Authentication

- [ ] Set up user authentication system
  - [ ] Implement JWT token generation
  - [ ] Create login/signup endpoints
  - [ ] Add password hashing with bcrypt

- [ ] Implement role-based access control
  - [ ] Create user roles table
  - [ ] Add middleware for permission checking
```

As your agent completes tasks, update the status:
- `[ ]` → `[→]` when starting
- `[→]` → `[✓]` when complete
- `[ ]` → `[\]` if skipping (add reason why)
