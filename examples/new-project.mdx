### Executive Summary
```
# Project Management SaaS Platform

## Overview
A comprehensive project management solution enabling teams to collaborate effectively with kanban boards, sprint planning, time tracking, and external integrations.

## Core Features
- Team-based project organization
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality
- Sprint planning and burndown charts
- Time tracking and reporting
- Slack and GitHub integrations
- Role-based access control
```

### Technical Architecture
```
## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Real-time:** Socket.io for live updates
- **Authentication:** Clerk for user management
- **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend, Railway for backend

### System Components
- Web application for project management
- REST API for integrations
- Real-time WebSocket server
- Background job processing
- File storage and CDN
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- [ ] Set up project structure and development environment
- [ ] Implement user authentication with Clerk
- [ ] Create database schema with Prisma
- [ ] Set up basic API structure

#### Phase 2: Core Features (3 weeks)
- [ ] Build project and team management
- [ ] Implement kanban board functionality
- [ ] Add task creation and editing
- [ ] Create team collaboration features

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement sprint planning
- [ ] Add time tracking
- [ ] Build reporting dashboards
- [ ] Integrate Slack notifications

#### Phase 4: Integrations (1 week)
- [ ] GitHub integration for issue sync
- [ ] Slack integration for notifications
- [ ] Webhook system for external services

### Sample User Stories

#### User Authentication & Teams
**As a user, I want to:**
- Create and join teams
- Invite team members with different roles
- Manage team permissions and access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create teams with unique URLs
- Team admins can invite members via email
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Member, Viewer)
- Secure authentication with proper session management

#### Kanban Board Management
**As a team member, I want to:**
- Create and customize kanban boards
- Move tasks between columns
- Set up custom workflow stages
- View board activity and changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Drag-and-drop task movement
- Real-time updates for all team members
- Custom column configuration
- Task history and audit trail

### Risk Analysis
- **Integration Complexity:** Slack/GitHub APIs may have rate limits
- **Real-time Performance:** WebSocket connections for large teams
- **Data Migration:** Future scaling considerations
- **Security:** Proper access control for team data

## Using with Agents

### With Cursor

1. **Generate the spec** using the API call above
2. **Click "Open in Cursor"** on your spec page, or use the deep link:
   ```
   cursor://file?url=https://pre.dev/s/your-spec-id
   ```
3. **The spec opens directly in Cursor** - no manual copying needed
4. **Start development** with the complete context loaded

**Cursor Workflow:**
- Spec remains open as reference during development
- Use task checkboxes to track progress
- Reference specific sections when asking questions
- Agent stays aligned with the architectural vision

### With Lovable

1. **Generate the spec** and get the hosted URL
2. **Click "Open in Lovable"** or use the direct link:
   ```
   https://lovable.dev/projects/create?template=https://pre.dev/s/your-spec-id
   ```
3. **Lovable loads the spec** as complete project context
4. **Automatic project setup** based on the specification

**Lovable Workflow:**
- Spec transforms into actionable development tasks
- Break down large specs into manageable phases
- Focus on one milestone at a time
- Collaborative development with the spec as guide

### With Bolt

1. **Generate the spec** with `outputFormat: "url"`
2. **Navigate to your spec page** on pre.dev
3. **Click "Open in Bolt"** button
4. **Bolt creates a new project** with the spec as context

**Bolt Workflow:**
- Best for smaller, focused feature sets
- Reference spec sections for specific features
- Quick prototyping and validation
- Seamless handoff from specification to implementation

### With Claude Desktop (MCP)

1. **Configure MCP** following the [setup guide](/mcp-integration/setup)
2. **Ask Claude to generate the spec:**
   ```
   "Generate a comprehensive spec for a project management SaaS with kanban boards, sprint planning, time tracking, team collaboration, and Slack/GitHub integrations"
   ```
3. **Claude uses the Architect API** automatically via MCP
4. **Spec opens in your browser** with deep links available

**MCP Workflow:**
- Conversational spec generation and refinement
- Natural language iteration on requirements
- Direct integration with Claude's long context window
- Seamless transition from planning to development

## Expected Results

After following this example, you'll have:

✅ **Complete project roadmap** with 4 implementation phases
✅ **Technical architecture** decisions made
✅ **15+ user stories** with detailed acceptance criteria
✅ **Risk analysis** and mitigation strategies
✅ **Task tracking system** for progress management
✅ **Integration specifications** for Slack and GitHub
✅ **Deployment and infrastructure** recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Review the generated spec** thoroughly
2. **Clarify any ambiguous requirements** with stakeholders
3. **Choose your preferred agent** (Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, or MCP)
4. **Begin implementation** following the phase structure
5. **Track progress** using the built-in task system
6. **Iterate as needed** - specs are living documents

This example demonstrates how Architect API transforms a high-level idea into a production-ready project specification in seconds, enabling you to start building with complete context from day one.
